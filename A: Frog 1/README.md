## Problem A: Frog  1
### Problem Statement

You are given an array A of length N. Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of elements you can get by choosing some of the elements such that no two elements you choose are adjacent.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), the size of the array.
- The second line contains N integers, representing the elements of the array A (1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^3).

## Output

Output a single integer, the maximum possible sum of elements you can obtain by choosing some of the elements such that no two elements you choose are adjacent.

## Example

Input:
```
4
4 1 1 9
```

Output:
```
13
```

## Explanation

In the given example, you can choose elements 4 and 9 to obtain the maximum sum of 13.
